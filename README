cdm-batch (version 0.0.1)                  https://github.com/ksclarke/cdm-batch

================================================================================
INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

This is a PHP script that will perform simple batch updates on your ContentDM
metadata.  There is a built-in search and replace in ContentDM itself, but this
script will allow you to supply a record ID, field name, and new field value
and have all the requested records updated with the new field value supplied.
It uses a CSV file, with those three parameters, as its input.  There is also
a simple Web interface for uploading and running these simple batch CSV files.


================================================================================
INSTALLATION
================================================================================

You can check out the project from Github or download the latest release from
the Github project home page (on the top, right side of the screen).

To find the project on Github, go to:

   https://github.com/ksclarke/cdm-batch

You can install it wherever you like as long as you configure your ContentDM
instance info in the config.xml file (see the config.xml.sample file for more
information about how to configure the script).
